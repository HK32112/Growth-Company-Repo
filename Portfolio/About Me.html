    <p>
        I am a current student that has recently completed an undergraduate degree in BSc Computer Science
        and I am actively seeking opportunities in the technology sector which would then enable me to showcase my 
        skills and talent, and my dream job would be to become a software developer in industry. Outside of my studies, 
        I enjoy gaming, watching television shows, spending time with my family, watching football games, and listening to music.
        I possess key skills such as communication, time management, collaboration which make me a valuable asset to
        a company
